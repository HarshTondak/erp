# ERP System with React

The goal of this project is to create a simplified interface for an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system, designed to manage basic business operations efficiently. The system will consist of the following pages:

- Dashboard - Provides an overview of the system's features.

- Products Management - Allows for the management of product listings.

- Orders Management - Facilitates viewing and handling orders.

- Orders Calendar View - A calendar interface displaying orders based on their expected delivery dates.

## Solution

- The assignment is done using `React.js`.
- I have used the following `Syncfusion` to implement the calender feature.
- I have designed a beautiful single page interface.
- I developed a user-friendly interface for managing key aspects of a business.
- I utilized React for building modular components and managing application state.
- I implemented navigation between different sections of the ERP system using React Router.
- This website is fully responsive for all screen sizes.
